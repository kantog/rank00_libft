This is the first project of the Campus 19 Common Core (part of the international 42 Network). 
It teaches us never to take the basic functions we use while programming for granted, by letting us create our own library, to use in later projects.

From the documentation: 

 _C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to the highly useful
  standard functions. This project is about understanding the way these functions work,
  implementing and learning to use them. Your will create your own library. It will be
  helpful since you will use it in your next C school assignments._

Allowed functions: free, malloc, write.
